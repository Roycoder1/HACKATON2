Hello roy. I liked your project it is fun and nicely done.


Some tips for other projects.:

try to import you files and images in a way that is accesible for others when download your project.
avoid to use local path to your computer and use absolute path to the project itself.
Try to put the images, sounds and every extra file in order in to folders. 

There is some files that you are using that are not even in this folder so part of your project is not working. like the images. or the fonts

Still your code is well organized and well done. congratulation for your project and keep the good work
